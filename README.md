### Child Marriage Across the Globe 
This is an infogrpahic looking at the data of child marriages around the world. For this infogrpahic I used Canva. I collected the data from UNICEF. I chose to look into this because child marriage is a very prevelant problem that not a lot of people talk about. I wanted to get the information out there and make people aware.

### Global CO2 Emissions Chart
The global CO2 emissions from 1950-2010. This shows the increase of global CO2 emissions over the years. This is important becasue it shows how much it has increased, since 1950 is has more than doubled. This data also only goes up to 2010 so the emissions are probably even higher now. I used chartbuilder to make this graph.

### U.S Poverty Rates from 1990-2020
This line chart shows the poverty rates in the U.S over 30 years. It's interesting to see how much is fluctuates over the years. There is a big spike in 2008-2010 which is when the financial crisis happened but after that it starts to go down again. It would be interesting to see how Covid has affected the poverty rates.
